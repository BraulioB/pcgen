I noticed that there was no ASPECT for Inspired Panache showing up on the PDFs.  Also, the value generated on the regular character
sheets for Inspired Panache was always 0.

Here's my substitution for Inspired Panache in line 4672 of the acg_abilities_class.lst list in the 
PCGen\PCGen60601\data\pathfinder\paizo\roleplaying_game\advanced_class_guide folder.


Code:

Inspired Panache                                    KEY:Inspired Blade ~ Inspired Panache                            CATEGORY:Special Ability    TYPE:Swashbuckler Class Feature.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Panache        DEFINE:PanachePoints|0        DEFINE:InspiredBladeDefaultPanache|0        DEFINE:FavoredClassBonus|0        DESC:Each day, an inspired blade gains %1 panache points. Unlike other swashbucklers, an inspired blade gains no panache from a killing blow. She gains panache only from scoring a critical hit with a rapier. This ability alters the panache class feature.|PanachePoints        BONUS:VAR|PanachePoints|InspiredBladeDefaultPanache    BONUS:VAR|PanachePoints|FavoredClassBonus    BONUS:VAR|InspiredBladeDefaultPanache|MAX(1,CHA)+MAX(1,INT)    BONUS:VAR|FavoredClassBonus|(ElfSwashbucklerFavClassBonus/4)+(HumanSwashbucklerFavClassBonus/4)        ASPECT:CheckType|Points    ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|PanachePoints    SOURCEPAGE:p.125



Notes;  The code for BONUS:VAR|FavoredClassBonus looks a bit clumsy to me, but it was the only way I could grab the value for
the Favored Class Bonus that Elves and Humans get.
